# CBS-2021

## What is CBS?

CBS (Conflict Based Search) is an algorithm for solving multi-agent pathplanning problems. In the multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem, we are given a graph and a set of agents, each with its own start and finish point. The task is to construct a set of collision-free paths in such a way that agents reach their destinations as effectively as possible. In the classic formulation of the problem, time is discrete. At each time step an agent can either move to a neighboring location or wait in its current location. Both actions take exactly one time step. But in real life applications, agents often move at different speeds. Moreover, in practice, agents continuously receive new tasks instead of receiving a single task and disappearing after its completion. In this repository we present an open-source implementation of a MAPF solver where agents are constantly engaged with new goal locations and move at different speeds.

Here you can see two MAPF problems: on the left, the agents are moving with equal speeds; on the right, the purple agent is two times faster. The blue agent passes an edge in two time steps.

## Running the code

If you'd like to use this code, please:
1) compile it (for example, ```make build```),
2) specify the parameters in [call-multirobot.py](call-multirobot.py),
3) and run it with python3.

The code uses maps and scenarios from [Moving AI Lab](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf/index.html).

An example of a map can be found in the file [check.map](check.map) (same with examples of scenario and goal files: [check.scen](check.scen), [check.goals](check.goals)). 
In call-multirobot.py, one can choose which optimizations are going to be tested and enter the parameter values. 
The variables include:
- `path_to_bin` (path to the executable), 
- `path_to_map` (path to the map),
- `paths_to_scen` (paths to scenarios), 
- `path_to_goals` (path to the file with additional goals),
- `MAX_AGENTS` (the maximum number of agents),
- `MAX_SCEN` (the maximum number of scenarios), 
- `MAX_FAILED` (maximum consecutive failures, after which this scenario will not be included in tests with more agents), 
- `TIME_OUT` (the time limit in seconds), 
- `dijkstra_precalc` (set true to use exact heuristic precomputation),
- `use_CAT` (set true to use the conflict avoidance table), 
- `heuristic` (choose heuristic: normal, normal_diagonal, number_of_conflicts, number_of_conflicting_agents, number_of_pairs, vertex_cover), 
- `prioritize_conflicts` (set true to prioritize cardinal and semi-cardinal conflicts),
- `use_bypass` (set true to use the bypass technique),
- `use_ecbs` (set true to use suboptimal CBS),
- `omega` (choose suboptimality factor for ECBS),
- `use_symm` (set true to use symmetry breaking constraints),
- `online` (choose an online setting with many goals or an offline setting with one goal),
- `horizon` (conflicts will be ignored after this number of steps),
- `replanning` (the number of timesteps before replanning),
- `print_paths` (set true to print paths for each agent).

## More on file formats

All maps begin with the lines:

```
type octile
height y
width x
map
```

where y and x are the respective height and width of the map.

The map data is store as an ASCII grid. The upper-left corner of the map is (0,0). The following characters are possible:

- `. G S W` - passable terrain,
- `@ O T` - out of bounds or unpassable terrain.

A scenario is a text file with a list of start and finish points for each agent. Each line of a scenario has 9 fields: bucket, map, map width, map height, start x-coordinate, start y-coordinate, goal x-coordinate, goal y-coordinate, optimal length. The optimal path length is assuming sqrt(2) diagonal costs.

A goals file contains additional goals for agents in the online setting. Every line contains a list of goal x-coordinates and goal y-coordinates, followed by -1.

## Code structure

This repository contains the following files:

#### [agent.cpp](agent.cpp)

A file describing the Agent class. `Agent::Agent(int agentId)` describes how an agent is initialized: its starting point (start_i,start_j) equals (-1,-1), the function receives its id as a parameter and its speed equals 1. `Agent::getAgent(std::ifstream& agentFile, bool online)` is a helper function for reading agent parameters from a scenario file. If `online == true`, the goal file is parsed. Otherwise, only one goal point is read from the scenario file. The agent's speed is chosen randomly.

#### [agent.h](agent.h)

A file describing the agent class. The type of fin_i and fin_j is `std::vector<int>`: while each agent has only one starting location, it can have multiple goal locations.

#### [call-multirobot.py](call-multirobot.py)

A file to make running the executable with different parameters easier. Sets up a timer for each map-scenario combination, kills the MAPF solver, if it takes too much time. For each number of agents from 1 to 100, the algorithm is tested on 25 scenarios. Then, the percentage of successfully executed scenarios (success rate) is counted.

#### [check.goals](check.goals)

A dummy goals file for two agents.

#### [check.map](check.map)

A dummy 4x5 map.

#### [check.scen](check.scen)

A dummy scenario file for two agents.

#### [constr.h](constr.h)

A file describing Constraint and Conflict structures. A constraint has the following fields:
- `std::string type`,
- `int agent`,
- `int time`,
- `std::pair<int, int> v1`,
- `std::pair<int, int> v2`.

There are two types of constraints: a vertex constraint, where the agent is not allowed to be in v1 at a certain time, and an edge constraint, where the agent is not allowed to be in vertex v1 and try to reach vertex v2 at a certain time. Barrier constraints consist of vertex constraints.

A conflict has the following fields:
- `std::string type`,
- `std::pair<int, int> agents`,
- `int time1`,
- `int time2`,
- `std::pair<int, int> v1`,
- `std::pair<int, int> v2`.

There are four types of conflicts: a vertex conflict, where agent[0] and agent[1] collided in v1 at a certain time; an edge conflict, where agent[0] was traveling from v1 to v2 at a certain time, agent2 was traveling from v2 to v1; type none conflict (no conflict) and a rectangle conflict.

#### [ctNode.h](ctNode.h)

A file describing the CTNode class, a class for constraint tree nodes. There are some helper types and structures: `VertexConstrStruct` for vertex constraints; `EdgeConstrStruct` for edge constraints; `Path` for paths (each step is a `std::pair<int, int>`); `StateMap`, an unordered map, where the key is a tuple (an agent's state, `i j t`) and the value is a set of agents in that state; `KeyFour`, `KeyFourHash`, `KeyFourEqual` and `pair_hash` for hashing and comparison purposes; `EventVertex` and `EventEdge` for fast conflict detection.

There are some helper types and structures: `VertexConstrStruct` for vertex constraints; `EdgeConstrStruct` for edge constraints; `Path` for paths (each step is a `std::pair<int, int>`); and `StateMap`, an unordered map, where the key is a tuple (an agent's state, `i j t`) and the value is a set of agents in that state. The file contains two comparators, `bool CompareAStar(const SearchNode& one, const SearchNode& two)` and `bool CompareFocal(const SearchNode& one, const SearchNode& two)`. The first one is used in basic A* to compare nodes in `OPEN` by their f-value.

In the offline setting, those are two points: an arbitrary point (i1,j1) and a goal point (i2,j2).

- `double f, g, h`, f-, g- (the cost of the path from the start node to the current node) and h-values (a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from the current node to the goal) of the node. f(n) = g(n) + h(n),
- `SearchNode *parent`, the state-time previous to the current one,
- `int label`, the number of goal locations in the goal location sequence that the corresponding path from the root node to the current node has already visited.
